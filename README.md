1. **When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?**

In this project, I explored the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. I compared a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown. This project was part of the Datacamp 'Data Analyst in SQL' track and was mandatory for certification.
